# Social-Media-Website-Socialize
The project titled “Socialize” (Social Media Website) is a web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, aiming to replicate the functionalities of popular social media platforms like Instagram.The primary goal of this project was to create a dynamic and interactive platform where users can do several tasks like, Profile creation, Images upload function, engage with posts through likes and comments, and connect with other users.
The project encompasses several key features including user authentication, profile management, post creation and comment interaction, as well as a search functionality. Additionally, the website is designed with a responsive layout to ensure compatibility across various devices.
This project not only allowed us to apply our knowledge of "Front-End Technologies" but also challenged us to implement advanced features such as a follow/unfollow system, real-time notifications, and secure password handling.
